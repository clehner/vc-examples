      <p>
        A customer loyalty card is traditionally a plastic card given to a
        customer by a retailer. Scanned at point of sale, it contains a
        persistent identifier that the retailer uses to identify the customer
        and correlate their purchases over time. It may be associated with an
        online account and/or digital coupons issued to the customer.
      </p>
      <p class="note" title="Unstable Vocabulary">
        The vocabulary terms that appear in this document and the associated
        JSON-LD context file have not been reviewed for standards-track adoption
        by any entity. They serve primarily as an example of how a customer
        loyalty credential may function and are ready for review by appropriate
        communities and groups.
